      <h1> Reading The Problem Statement</h1>
      <p>
        In coding challenges and problems, being able to understand the problem statement is often half the battle.
        I've written some purposefully-convoluted practice problem statements, along with a set of questions for each problem set.
      </p>
      <p>
        You answer most of these questions simply by selecting the part of the problem statement that provides the answer.
        At the end, there are usually a few follow-up questions that you answer by filling in the blank.
